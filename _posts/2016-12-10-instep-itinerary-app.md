### **CLIENT: **MCT Agency GmbH Berlin

### **ROLE: **Concept, Design, Prototype

### **OVERVIEW: **Instep is an extensible itinerary tool, that enables Concert Tour Management Agencies like MCT Agency GmbH Berlin, to organise and plan entire tours, flights, hotels, venues, etc.

### **PROCESS: **"From Highway to Hell" (a printed DIN A5 Booklet) to "Stairway to Heaven". From "Book of Lies" to "App of Truth"

### Simple tour planning by creating as many travel-parties and time-boxes as you need.

**Plan a Tour**

Integrate important basic data and additional information to the time-boxes. The information you enter is stored in your data pool. In order to facilitate the recording, the system refers to this data pool, each time you enter this data again.

**Edit information on the road**  
If a problem occurs for example "The driver is delayed by 30 minutes", the arrival time is updated by the tour management in the corresponding card. After the changes has been edited, a pre-made push message will be created and sent to the respective travel parties. To ensure that the message has been acknowledged, you can enable an instant feedback option.
