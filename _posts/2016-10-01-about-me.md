# **Hello. Let\`s talk.**

While developing solutions for websites and apps, I work through the full UX lifecycle from research to design and testing. Highly motivated people, who inspire me to live a meaningful life and give back to society are my kind of people.

As an Interaction Designer, I am working with the User Centered Design Approach to focus the user with his needs.

In addition to my passion for design, technology and art, I love learning about AI, VR and Nature.
