## "Embrace change: It is the only constant in life."

I'm a digital product designer based in Zurich. I believe that design is first and foremost about foucusing on the users needs and solving their problems.

During my career I worked with great companies such as NZZ, Mila, MCT, making sure to deliver the best customer experience, at every step of interaction with their product.

I work closely with your team, your customers and your stakeholders, to make sure that we deliver exactly what they need, while keeping an eye on your mission & business goals.

I want to learn from highly motivated people, who inspire me, to live a meaningful life and give back to society.
