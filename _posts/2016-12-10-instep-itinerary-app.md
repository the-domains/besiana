### **CLIENT: **MCT, Berlin

### **ROLE: **Concept, Design

### **OVERVIEW: **Instep is an extensible itinerary tool, that enables Concert Tour Management Agencies like MCT Agency GmbH, to organise and plan entire tours, flights, hotels, venues, etc.

### **PROCESS: **Simple tour planning by creating as many travel-parties and time-boxes as you need.

### **Plan a Tour:**

### Integrate important basic data and additional information to the time-boxes. The information you enter is stored in your data pool. The system refers to this data pool, each time you enter this data again.

### **Edit information on the road:**

### If a problem occurs for e.g. "The driver is delayed by 30 min", the arrival time is updated by the tour management in the corresponding card. After the changes have been edited, a pre-made push message will be send to the respective travel parties.
