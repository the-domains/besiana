**Land grabbing play rules:**

1. The Board is shared by both players
2. Each player selects one color
3. At game start all players get two patterns at random
4. If a pattern is set on the board, a new pattern spawns in the spot
5. At game end, each cube of the biggest coherent group of patterns is worth a point
