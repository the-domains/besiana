I'm a User Experience designer, who firmly believes, that design is first and foremost about focusing on the users needs and solving their problems.

During my career I worked with great companies such as, Migros, NZZ, Mila, MCT, making sure to enable the best customer experience, at every step of interaction with their product.

I am a team player, who works closely with the customers and stakeholders, to make sure that we deliver exactly what they need, while keeping an eye on the mission & business goals.

I want to learn from highly motivated people, who inspire me, to live a meaningful life and give back to society.
