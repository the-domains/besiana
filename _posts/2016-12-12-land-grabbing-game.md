**Land grabbing rule change:**

1. The Board is shared by both players.
2. Each player has one color.
3. At game start all players get two patterns at random
4. If a pattern is set on the board, a new pattern spawns in the spot.
5. At game end, each cube of the biggest coherent group of patterns is worth a point.
