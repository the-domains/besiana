# «Product experience is everyone's responsibility»

My responsibility as an Interaction Designer, is to focus on the user needs, while working on websites, apps, and print media. Therefor I work through the full User Experience lifecycle from research to design and testing.

I want to learn, from highly motivated people, who inspire me to live a meaningful life and give back to society.
