# «Product experience is everyone's responsibility»

My focus is on the user and their needs. While developing solutions for websites and apps, I work through the full UX lifecycle from research to design and testing.

I want to learn, from highly motivated people, who inspire me to live a meaningful life and give back to society.

If you want to know more about me, see my resume.
