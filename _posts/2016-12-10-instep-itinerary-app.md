**Tour Planning**  
Simple tour planning by creating as many travel-parties and time-boxes as you need.  
Plan the entire tour in detail and integrate important basic data and additional information to the time-boxes. The information you enter is stored in your data pool. In order to facilitate the recording, the system refers to this data pool, each time you enter this data again.

**Alert**  
If a problem occurs in this example "The driver is delayed by 30 minutes", the arrival time is updated by the tour management in the corresponding card. After the changes has been edited, a pre-made push message will be created and sent to the respective travel parties. To ensure that the message has been acknowledged, you can enable an instant feedback option.
