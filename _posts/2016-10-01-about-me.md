# **Hello. Let\`s talk.**

As an Interaction Designer, my focus is on the user and their needs. While developing solutions for websites and apps, I work through the full UX lifecycle from research to design and testing. 

Highly motivated people, who inspire me to live a meaningful life and give back to society are my kind of people.

In addition to my passion for design, technology and art, I love learning something new everyday.
