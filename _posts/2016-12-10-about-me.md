# **Hello. I am available for exciting things. Let\`s talk.**

As a hands on individual who isn't afraid of a pen and paper, I work through the full UX lifecycle from research to design and testing. I want to work with highly motivated people, who inspire me to live a meaningful life and give back to society.
