**Edit on the Road**  
If a problem occurs in this example "The driver is delayed by 30 minutes", the arrival time is updated by the tour management in the corresponding card. After the changes has been edited, a pre-made push message will be created and sent to the respective travel parties. To ensure that the message has been acknowledged, you can enable an instant feedback option.
