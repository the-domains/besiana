# **Let's talk**

As an Interaction Designer, my focus is on the user and their needs. While developing solutions for websites and apps, I work through the full UX lifecycle from research to design and testing.

I want to learn, from highly motivated people, who inspire me to live a meaningful life and give back to society.
