**Plan a Tour**Integrate important basic data and additional information to the time-boxes. The information you enter is stored in your data pool. In order to facilitate the recording, the system refers to this data pool, each time you enter this data again.

**Edit information on the road**  
If a problem occurs for example "The driver is delayed by 30 minutes", the arrival time is updated by the tour management in the corresponding card. After the changes has been edited, a pre-made push message will be created and sent to the respective travel parties. To ensure that the message has been acknowledged, you can enable an instant feedback option.
